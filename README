JiraAutomation

Python script used to automate creating/updating/deleting issues in Jira. Target is to minimize user's interaction so the script execution can be scheduled.

Script is using jira-python package to access Jira. As the source of data are used CSV files.

So far the script can create and delete issues, but the source CSV files need to have some specific fields, a.k.a hard-coding.
To specify which field in Jira is which filed in CSV file, is used mapping file.Other properties, like Jira url, username, password, etc. are in dictionary in main.py script.

This is my first attempt with Python !!!
